# Project Description UFOs 
The project was to design an webpage to provide access to UFO sighting data. A dataset is available for all the UFO sighting data in geographic granular data points. 
First phase of the project produced an user friendly search page with the ability to select subset of data based on date. 
In the next phase the design would be expanded to include search capability on several criteria including, city, state, country and shape of the sighted UFO object.

## Resources and Tools
* UFO sighting databased downloaded and hosted locally
* HTML/CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap methodology.

## Product Features
Initial product of landing page displays UFO sightings by date, city, state, country and shape level granularity. </br>
The following image provides a snapshot of the landing page:

This project targeted specific enhancements to the landing page by providing filtering data by user specified criteria. For example, user can enter specific date/city/state code/country code/shape of the UFO and the page is refreshed displaying data only corresponding to the filtering criteria. The following snapsot provides a sample display of search by state of Arizona (ar):

Similar functionality is provided for searching by city, country or shape.
The limited scope for enhancement makes a significant user friendly improvement for targeting dataset of interest. However, the user experienced could be further improved by streamling the searches more.

## Future Scope
In the latest design, the display could be confusing if multiple changes are successively made. Currently, only the last search criteria is used for search, but the previous filters are not erased from display. This may be confusing as the on screen country, state and city codes may not be congruent and compatible.
