# Project Description UFOs 
The project was to design an webpage to provide access to UFO sighting data. A dataset is available for all the UFO sighting data in geographic granular data points. 
First phase of the project produced an user friendly search page with the ability to select subset of data based on date. 
In the next phase the design would be expanded to include search capability on several criteria including, city, state, country and shape of the sighted UFO object.
